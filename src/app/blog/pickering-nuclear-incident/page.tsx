      <h2>Timeline</h2>
      <p>
        At 7:24 am today, an alert was sent to 15 million Ontario residents
        through the Canadian emergency alert system,
        <a href="https://www.alertready.ca">Alert Ready</a>.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>⚠️ EMERGENCY ALERT / ALERTE D&apos;URGENCE:</p>
        <p>
          This is a Province of Ontario emergency bulletin which applies to
          people within ten (10) kilometres of the Pickering Nuclear Generating
          Station. There has been NO abnormal release of radioactivity from the
          station and emergency staff are responding to the situation. People
          near the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station DO NOT need to take any
          protective actions at this time. Remained tuned to local media for
          further information and instructions.

        At 8:06 am, the power company OPG (Ontario Power Generation) tweeted a
        retraction.

        At 8:35 am the retraction was corroborated by the city of Pickering. It
        was also retweeted by the Durham Region and Durham Regional Police
        twitter accounts.

        At 9:10 am, an official retraction was finally published via the alert
        system.

      <blockquote>
        <p>⚠️ EMERGENCY ALERT / ALERTE D&apos;URGENCE:</p>

          There is NO active nuclear situation taking place at the Pickering
          Nuclear Generating Station. The previous alert was issued in error.

      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        Using Google News, I read all of the news coverage published up to 11:45
        am. I found that none of the news outlets were able to provide any
        information beyond the scope of what was in the original alerts and
        tweets. Some of the news outlets actually spread false information – 3
        articles incorrectly stated that the alert was only sent to the affected
        10km area.

          CBC&apos;s coverage

        demonstrated to be the most accurate and up to date.
      </p>
      <p>
        One source had a disproportionate level of access to insight: CBC
        Ontario provincial affairs reporter Mike Crawley. He was able to obtain
        statements from key parties faster than anyone else, confirming the
        event was a false alarm at 8:16 am.

        4 key organizations had some involvement in the communication of this
        incident. Note that the PEOC is a sub-division of the Ministry of the
        Solicitor General. Even though the Solicitor Generals office has issued
        an apology, confirming &quot;the alert was issued in error during a
        routine training exercise&quot;, all of these groups share a joint
        responsability to communicate effectively with the public, whether it is
        in the event of an actual incident or a false alarm.

        We do not know what happened in these organizations during this crucial
        period. Rest assured, the investigation will be sure to provide the
        public with a straightforward answer; some person will lose their job
        and we can all rest easy. Not quite.
      </p>
      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <p>
        The reality is that in any complex system, what can go wrong WILL go
        wrong given enough time. Systems submit to entropy. People make
        mistakes. False alarms happen. Lets hope a real one never does. The
        question is, what could have been done to mitigate damage done by a
        false alarm? As we&apos;ve seen from the Hawaii, these mistakes have
        measurable impacts on
        <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Famp0000495">
          mental health
        </a>
        . With 15 million Ontario residents, it is totally plausible that at
        least one of 15 million had a life-altering experience this morning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to draw your attention to the alert itself. Lets see how we can
        use common sense to craft a better message.
      </p>
      <h3>Geo-Fencing</h3>
      <p>
        The alerts are broadcast to the entire province instead of being
        geographically constrained, leading to increased
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alarm_fatigue">Alarm Fatigue</a>.
        A surprisingly large portion of people commenting on news articles and
        Twitter stated that their phones were turned off during the night,
        because they were sick of getting these emergency alerts. Ontario
        residents are sent alerts (usually Amber Alerts) for incidents happening
        very far away from them. This may or may not be valid for Amber Alerts,
        a cost benefit study should be done - nonethelesss if a message only
        applies to a specific area, as stated in the alert, why not use
        geofencing?
      </p>
      <h3>Confusing and Ominous Doublespeak</h3>
      <p>
        &quot;⚠️ EMERGENCY ALERT&quot;. &quot;NO abnormal release of
        radioactivity&quot;. &quot;emergency staff are responding to the
        situation&quot;. &quot;People ... DO NOT need to take any protective
        actions at this time&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        This sounds like something the USSR would send out at Chernobyl. What is
        this trying to tell me? Should I go back to sleep or prepare a bugout
        bag?
      </p>
      <h3>Clear Call to Action</h3>
      <p>
        &quot;Remained tuned to local media for further information and
        instructions.&quot; is quite unhelpful. We live in the age of the
        internet, social media, conversational bots and fake news. Why not
        specify their purpose-built website,
        <a href="https://preparetobesafe.ca">https://preparetobesafe.ca</a>? Or
        the ontario warnings
        <a href="https://twitter.com/OntarioWarnings">twitter account</a>?
      </p>
      <h3>Bilingual Support</h3>
      <p>
        The alerts include a title in French, but no translation of the message
        body. This unnecessarily crowds the screen while providing zero benefit
        to French speaking Canadians. Pick one or the other!
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Lets apply some of these suggestions to the message. Keep in mind my
        French is poor, so I didn&apos;t attempt to write a bilingual message.
      </p>
